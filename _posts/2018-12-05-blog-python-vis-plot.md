## 4 More Quick and Easy Data Visualizations

These methods include:

* [Heat Map](#heatmap)
* [Line Plot](#lineplot)
* [Histogram](#histogram)
* [Overlaid Histogram](#overlaidhistogram)
* [Bar Chart](barchart)
* [Box Plot](boxplot)

### Heat Map <a id="heatmap"></a>
A heat map is a matrix representation of data where each matrix value is represented 
as a colour. The different colours represent different magnitudes and the matrix indices 
link together the 2 items or features being compared. Heat maps are great for showing 
the relationships between multiple feature variables since you can directly see the 
magnitude as a colour. You can also see how each relationship compares to the other 
relationships in your dataset by looking at the other points in the heat map. The colour 
is really what provides the easy interpretation since it is so intuitive.
